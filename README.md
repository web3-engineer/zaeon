# Zaeon ‚Äî AI‚ÄëPowered EdTech with On‚ÄëChain Research Funding

Zaeon is an educational platform powered by **AI agents** that gamify access to daily **science, business, and entrepreneurship**. Students, teachers, and researchers collaborate with specialized agents that turn ideas into projects ‚Äî and high‚Äërank users can unlock **on‚Äëchain funding rails on the Sei blockchain** to support real‚Äëworld research and innovation.

> For the public, Zaeon is a playful, agent‚Äëpowered learning platform. Under the hood, it‚Äôs a modular research & funding stack that merges AI, data, and blockchain ‚Äî without making users think about the chain.

## Highlights
- üß† **Agent Workforce**: Specialized skills, tools, and memory; built‚Äëin planning and evaluation.
- üïπÔ∏è **Gamification**: Quests, streaks, levels, and seasonal rewards tied to learning outcomes.
- ‚õìÔ∏è **Sei Integration**: Funding pools, proposals, and milestone‚Äëbased payouts via CosmWasm contracts, with adapters for **goat‚Äësdk**, **Cambrian**, and **eliza plugin‚Äësei**.
- üìä **Data & Analytics**: Event pipeline, pgvector embeddings, feature store, and model registry.
- üß© **Monorepo**: Shared UI, types, prompts, and chain SDK; one PR ships cross‚Äëstack.

## Repo Structure (short)
See `/docs/Zaeon Monorepo Structure ‚Äî v1.md` for rationale. Key roots:

```

apps/{web,admin,studio,docs}
services/{agents,worker,api,gamification,analytics,notifier,model-registry}
packages/{ui,types,db,prompts,agents-runtime,chain-sei,chain-contracts,trpc,sdk,utils,feature-store,evals}

## Stacks ** [may change or vary during development] **
**Frontend**: Next.js (App Router), Tailwind, shadcn/ui, React Query, Zustand  
**Backend**: Next Route Handlers + (opt) Nest/Express service  
**DB**: Postgres + pgvector; Drizzle ORM (TS‚Äëfirst)  
**Cache/Queue**: Redis + BullMQ  
**Agents**: custom runtime + LangChain/LlamaIndex where pragmatic  
**Blockchain**: CosmJS + `packages/chain-sei` adapters (goat, cambrian, eliza)  
**MLOps**: Model registry (MLflow/W&B), feature store (typed, Postgres), evals  
**Observability**: OpenTelemetry, Sentry, Grafana/Tempo/Loki  
**Infra**: Docker/Compose (local), Terraform (cloud), GitHub Actions CI/CD

---

## Quickstart (local)
```bash
pnpm i
# spin infra
docker compose -f platform/docker/compose.dev.yml up -d
# run all workspaces
pnpm dev
````

### Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` at root and per app/service as needed.

## Development Workflow

* **Turborepo** drives tasks: `dev`, `build`, `lint`, `test`.
* **Changesets** for versioning packages; PRs require green `lint` + unit tests.
* **Preview deploys** per app on each PR; contracts/tests run in parallel.
* **Codeowners** gate sensitive paths (e.g., `packages/chain-sei`, `services/agents`).

---

## Data Science Playbook

* Use `/experiments` for notebooks and small datasets (checked in only if <5MB).
* Promote successful notebooks into `services/analytics` jobs or `packages/feature-store` pipelines.
* Register models via `services/model-registry` and ship **model cards** with eval metrics.
* Keep **dataset contracts** under `data/contracts` (Great Expectations or similar) and validate in CI.

---

## Agents

* Orchestrated via `services/agents` with a tool registry and memory backends.
* Prompts stored in `packages/prompts` with version tags; evals in `packages/evals`.
* Safety: tool quotas, sandboxed code runner, redaction on logs, PII minimization.

---

## Blockchain (Sei)

* All on‚Äëchain ops go through `packages/chain-sei` high‚Äëlevel API (create pool, proposal, vote, payout).
* Choose adapter in config: `goat`, `cambrian`, `eliza`.
* **Dry‚Äërun** sim available for users without wallets.

---

## Testing

* **Vitest** for TS; **contract tests** via local wasmd; **prompt evals** via `packages/evals`.
* E2E smoke via Playwright for `apps/web` critical flows.

---

## Security (!!!!!!!!!!)

* Secret scanning, dependency review, SBOM (Syft) & image scans (Trivy).
* Audit logs for admin actions and payouts; rate limits on agent tools.
